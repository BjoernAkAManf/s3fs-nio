## Yet another fork !?!

![fixed-the-code-will-be-meme]({{assets}}/fixed-the-code-will-be.jpg)

The lack of a stable, fully working, maintained and well-documented S3 filesystem driver for Java was the reason 
for us to create this project. There are a few projects which have partially implemented some features, but their 
authors have abandoned the projects and/or are seriously outdated. We have borrowed code from the ones which were 
under `Apache 2.0` and `MIT` and have created this project.

## Borrowed code

Projects we've borrowed code from:
 
 * @martint/s3fs - not maintained since 2012, `Apache 2.0`
 * @Upplication/Amazon-S3-FileSystem-NIO2 - not maintained since 2018, `Apache 2.0`, `MIT`
 * Many fixes done by contributors that did not get merged in the above repositories.
 
## Goals
 
Ultimately we don't want this to become "yet another dead fork" which "fixes just that one thing".
In the long term, we aim to: 

1. Build a stable community of contributors who help with implementing new features, improvements, maintenance and 
   keeping the documentation up-to-date. 

2. Make regular releases with patches, fixes and feature updates.

3. Keep this project alive for a long time.
