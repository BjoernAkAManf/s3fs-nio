# License

This project would not have been possible without the initial implementation(s) done by:
 
 * @martint/s3fs (initial implementation, `Apache 2.0`)  
 * @Upplication/Amazon-S3-FileSystem-NIO2 (fork with fixes, mainly `Apache 2.0`, but some `MIT` as well)
 * Other forks (only ones licensed under `Apache 2.0` or `MIT`)

We deeply value and respect the work of all involved developers, which is why @carlspring/s3fs-nio2 has been `dual-licensed`:

1. All existing code will continue to be licensed under the respectful initial license - either `MIT` or `Apache 2.0`
2. For consistency reasons - all future code **will be** licensed under `Apache 2.0`

## Apache 2.0

The latest version can be found in the [LICENSE.Apache-2.0.md] file in the @carlspring/s3fs-nio2 repository.
