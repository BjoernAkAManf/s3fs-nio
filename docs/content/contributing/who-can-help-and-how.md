# Who Can Help

We are always pleased to get help with our project! Both experienced and not so experienced developers are welcome!

There are many tasks you can help with, so please feel free to look around our [issue tracker] for some good first issues that we need help with.

You can also start by having a look at our code quality and coverage issues in [Sonarcloud].

Let us know what you're good at on out [chat] channel, as well as what sort of tasks you're typically interested in, or what areas of your skills you'd like to develop and we'll try to accomodate, by finding you the right tasks. It might be the case that we have tasks that are suitable for you, but just haven't yet been added to the issue tracker, so feel free to ask us how you can help!

We try our best to help new-joiners get started and eased into the project.

*Please, note that while a certain level of help will be provided to newcomers, anyone who wishes to contribute to this project must be able to work independently.*

## Academics

We're all here to learn cool new things and share the knowledge.

### Professors

Please, reach out to us, if you're teaching programming classes and would like your students to do some work on OSS projects!

Either raise a question in the issue tracker, join our [chat], or contact @carlspring for more details. We would be happy to hear about your curriculum and expectations of your students. 

### Students And Interns

We welcome students from all backgrounds, who have sane knowledge of programming, a willingness to learn, an openness to constructive criticism and a passion to deliver working code!

Finding your first few jobs might sometimes be challenging, but having contributed to an OSS project could give your CV quite a boost, as it shows initiative, dedication and self-drivenness, among other things.

# How To Help

We could use all the help we can get, so, please feel free to have a good look at our issue tracker and find something of interest, that you think you would be able to help with and just add a comment under the respective issue that you'll be looking into it. If somebody else was looking at it, but seems to have been inactive for more than a few days, please feel free to ask them if they've abandoned the task, if they're blocked, or waiting for information. They might still be researching the topic, but also, please keep in mind that sometimes people can no longer work on an issue (time constraints, change of circumstances, etc).
