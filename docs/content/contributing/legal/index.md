# Legal Overview

## Legal Notes And Credits

We appreciate all the help that we can get and are always open to cooperating with contributors. However, it is our
responsibility towards both all the contributors as well as the users of this library to clarify the licensing and
protect both sides' rights and interests.

Developers who wish to contribute to this project will need to sign our Contributor License Agreement (either in a PDF,
or by printing and signing it and sending it over regular mail). Contributors should only submit their own work product
(either as an individual, or as a company).

The work on this project is based on [martint/s3fs]'s and [Upplication/Amazon-S3-FileSystem-NIO2]'s projects.
[Upplication/Amazon-S3-FileSystem-NIO2] is a fork of [martint/s3fs].
[martint/s3fs]'s project is under the Apache 2.0 license.
[Upplication/Amazon-S3-FileSystem-NIO2]'s project is under the MIT license.

As a further clarification:

* The code that we've borrowed, which belongs to each of the above-mentioned projects will retain its original license.
* New code will be under the Apache 2.0 license.
* Contributors agree to have their code/fixes available under both the Apache 2.0 and MIT licenses.
* Contributors representing a company or other organization (collectively referred to below as "organization"), should
  each sign a separate CLA and clarify that they're representing the organization. If this is not possible, then the
  lead contributors from the organization should sign the ICLA and clarify that they are making this contribution on
  behalf of the organization and that it may include works of other authors in their organization.
